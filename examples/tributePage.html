        <h1>Artist Kusama Yayoi</h1>
        <p>
          Kusama Yayoi is a Japanese contemporary artist who works primarily in
          sculpture and installation, and is also active in painting,
          performance, video art, fashion, poetry, fiction, and other arts.

          Kusama Yayoi used high-color-contrast polka-dot patterns and mirrors
          to cover a large number of surfaces of various objects. Kusama Yayoi
          said that these visual features all come from her hallucinations, and
          she believes that these dots form an infinite net to represent her
          life.

        <h2>Here's a time line of Artist Kusama Yayoi 's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1929</strong> - Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939</strong> - Hallucinations and auditory hallucinations,
            and often suicide attempts. She kept the pencil drawing she drew for
            her mother at that time, which was already full of small dots.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1950</strong> - she was depicting abstract natural forms in
            water colour, gouache, and oil paint, primarily on paper. She began
            covering surfaces—walls, floors, canvases, and later, household
            objects, and naked assistants—with the polka dots that became a
            trademark of her work.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1954</strong> - she created painting Flower (D.S.P.S)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1957</strong> - she moved to Seattle, where she had an
            exhibition of paintings at the Zoe Dusanne Gallery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1963</strong> - she continued her series of Mirror/Infinity
            rooms. In these complex infinity mirror installations, purpose-built
            rooms lined with mirrored glass contain scores of neon-colored
            balls, hanging at various heights above the viewer. Standing inside
            on a small platform, an observer sees light repeatedly reflected off
            the mirrored surfaces to create the illusion of a never-ending
            space.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1973</strong> - she returned to Japan. Her reception from
            the Japanese art world and press was unsympathetic; one art
            collector recalled considering her a "scandal queen".She was in ill
            health, but continued to work, writing shockingly visceral and
            surrealistic novels, short stories, and poetry.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1980</strong> - she was forgotten as an artist until the
            late 1980s and 1990s, when a number of retrospectives revived
            international interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1994</strong> - The 2.5-meter-wide "Pumpkin" made of
            fiberglass-reinforced plastic, was installed on a pier on Naoshima,
            Kagawa, becoming iconic as the artist's profile grew in the
            following decades.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2017</strong> - The Kusama Yayoi Museum opened in Tokyo,
            featuring her works.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>future</strong> - LOVE IS CALLING will be on view and
            accessible to the public through 2024.
          </li>
